                                        Estate Planning is a process of arranging and planning a person's succession and financial affairs. An Estate Plan which incorporates a person's wishes about his estate, could be regarding Estate Management, Estate Preservation and Estate Legacy during and post life. The primary goal of estate planning is ensuring that the estate of the individual passes to the estate owner's intended beneficiaries, often including efficient tax and succession planning and avoiding or minimizing court proceedings in succession matters and obtaining probates (i.e. a "Will" certified under the seal of the court with the grant of administration to the estate of person who has made the Will).
